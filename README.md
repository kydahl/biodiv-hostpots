Data and code for "Comparisons of traditional ecological knowledge, taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic biodiversity metrics reveal dissimilarities in biodiversity hotspot identification"

# Brief abstract
As global climate change continues to impact ecosystems, scientists and policymakers agree that establishing conservation priorities is crucial for effectively managing threatened areas with limited resources. As such, biodiversity hotspots play a key role in global conservation efforts and are typically defined as an area containing endemic species comprising 0.5% of all plant species globally. However, classically defined biodiversity hotspots may not always reveal the full extent of biodiversity, including functional and phylogenetic biodiversity, or biodiversity incorporating traditional ecological knowledge (TEK). Here we compare the biodiversity hotspots identified by 17 diversity indices in the Pacific Northwest, USA; a region with rich published datasets on indigenous knowledge, shared with consent from local Indigenous communities. Utilizing data from 318 plant species, we consider measures of biodiversity that represent species richness, phylogenetic diversity, functional diversity, and TEK-based diversity. Using simulated plant communities, we assess whether indices identify the same biodiversity hotspots. We find that biodiversity metrics cluster into two groups based on shared hotspot identification, suggesting that prioritizing biodiversity conservation using a single metric may disregard other forms of diversity. Surprisingly, indices did not cluster solely based on category- not all of the functional measures group together and phylogenetic measures are widely dispersed between the two groups- providing further support for considering multiple assessments of biodiversity. Interestingly, TEK metrics cluster with some classically utilized indices, such as species richness. This work offers new insights on integrating biodiversity measures for discerning regional biodiversity hotspots and conservation priorities.
